    <h1>Essay: Introduction of Web Development</h1>
    <h2>By: Ashly Jana A. Quising</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> Learning HTML is fun so i found out that In our lesson about “Introduction to Web Development,” I learned how websites are made. <br>
        I found out that HTML is the main language used to build web pages.<br>
         It gives structure and meaning to everything we see online.</p>

    <p>I also understood that HTML has a clear structure. The head part holds the title and information about the page, while the body part shows the main content.<br>
         Every tag has an opening and closing, and they must be used correctly. I realized that small mistakes in tags can change how a webpage looks. <br>
         This taught me to be careful and patient when writing code.</p>
         
         <p>After learning HTML, I want to create my own personal website. It will have my picture, skills, and a short description about me. <br>
            I also want to add my school projects and contact details. I plan to use headings, paragraphs, images, and links to make it simple but nice.<br>
             Learning HTML made me excited to design a real website in the future.</p>
